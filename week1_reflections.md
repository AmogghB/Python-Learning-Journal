So far, I have learned and a reviewed about data structures.
This includes the different types of data, including records, arrays, linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs. 
Additionally, about algorithms, which is a set of simple instructions for solving a problem.
Abstract data types (ADTs) are another concept which describes data structures at a high-level. They include: lists, dynamic arrays, stacks, queues, and sets
