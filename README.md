# Python-Learning-Journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

# About Me
I am currently a 12th grade student at Prospect High School. My previous experience in programming includes taking AP Computer Science A, a basic Python course, and individual frequent use of various artificial intelligence models for both real-world and programming applications.

# Goals for This Course
For this course, I am excited to increase my general knowledge of coding in Python. However, more importantly, I would like to gain skills that I will be able to apply in my career and throughout college. This includes team collaboration, learning about various logical approaches to programming, and utilizing AI and outside tools to increase efficiency.
